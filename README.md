# FinanceClose
Simulates a mini financial close and reporting pipeline using a real General Ledger extract . It takes raw GL data, lands it in SQL Server, models it into a star schema, and surfaces an interactive P&amp;L report in Power BI—mirroring how enterprise tools like Longview Close and Workiva’s Wdata support “last‑mile” financial reporting.
